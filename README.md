# MQTT-Explorer
This is my humble contribution to the MQTT Community.
MQTT Explorer is a java FX Tree Viewer for MQTT brokers.
Since I couldn't find an all java solution with similar functionality I decided to get my hands dirty in my inexistent free time.
It is far from finished and all help to make it something noteworthy is appreciated.
To run it run the launcher and set up a broker on the first tab put the url and port in the combobox and click connect.
It is really simple but can show all the data on my moquette broker perfectly.
